# Flyde - Visual Programming Inside VSCode

_"The world is asynchronous - don't try to force the systems we build into a synchronous framework!" - J. Paul Morisson R.I.P_

Flyde is a visual functional reactive flow-based programming tool that can be used to build anything from CLI tools to bots and webapps.

Checkout the official website at [flyde.dev](https://www.flyde.dev) or the [examples](/examples) folder for more information

**Note:** Flyde is still WIP and is not intended for production use (_yet_)
